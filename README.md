# Experiment Launcher 🧪🚀

This example shows how to trigger a run through a custom UI.

The `experiment-launcher` UI fetches and presents parameters
from the past runs of the `CascadingParameters` flow.

You can parametrize a new experiment based on the old values
and then launch a run in the UI. This will create an event
with the parameter payload, triggering a run.
